First Rep!

Hello Reader!

This is my first time doing something like this and I am a total noob
I love to run and work out and want to be a master programmer!

This is me as of 2017
I'm about to graduate from highschool a year early, yay me ...
I need to start getting serious about what I want to do: Programming.
Hopefully I can get something out of learning.
